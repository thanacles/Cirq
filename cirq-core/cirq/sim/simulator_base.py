    """A base class for the built-in simulators.

    Most implementors of this interface should implement the
    `_create_partial_act_on_args` and `_create_step_result` methods. The first
    one creates the simulator's quantum state representation at the beginning
    of the simulation. The second creates the step result emitted after each
    `Moment` in the simulation.

    Iteration in the subclass is handled by the `_core_iterator` implementation
    here, which handles moment stepping, application of operations, measurement
    collection, and creation of noise. Simulators with more advanced needs can
    override the implementation if necessary.

    Sampling is handled by the implementation of `_run`. This implementation
    iterates the circuit to create a final step result, and samples that
    result when possible. If not possible, due to noise or classical
    probabilities on a state vector, the implementation attempts to fully
    iterate the unitary prefix once, then only repeat the non-unitary
    suffix from copies of the state obtained by the prefix. If more advanced
    functionality is required, then the `_run` method can be overridden.

    Note that state here refers to simulator state, which is not necessarily
    a state vector. The included simulators and corresponding states are state
    vector, density matrix, Clifford, and MPS. Each of these use the default
    `_core_iterator` and `_run` methods.
